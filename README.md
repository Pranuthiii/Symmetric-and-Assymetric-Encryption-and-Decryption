# Symmetric-and-Assymetric-Encryption-and-Decryption
This program is to create an encoding and decoding project that helps to encode and decode symmetric and assymetrically
it is a simple program without the use of GUI
simple follow through with the program's questions to get your encrypted message.
To decrypt a message you must type in the same encrypted message, else it will not work
if you want to change the keys, simply change the prime number of the program and it will change the keys in the assymetric encryption and decryption.
